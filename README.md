# Week 4: Expense Tracker Management with Data Manipulation Language (DML)

Great work last week! With just a little more practice you will be an expert at retrieving and summarizing your expense data. This week, we'll dive into Data Manipulation Language (DML), empowering you to actively manage your Expense Tracker project.

## Learning Objectives:

Master INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements for data manipulation in your Expense Tracker.
Confidently add new expenses, update existing ones, and remove unwanted entries.
Understand and handle NULL values effectively in your database.

**What you'll need:**

Access to a computer with internet access
A text editor (e.g., Notepad, Google Docs)
Access to your Expense Tracker database (instructor-provided data)
Important Note: It's recommended to practice on a copy of your Expense Tracker database to avoid accidental modifications to your main data set.

 ## Questions (2 hours):

**1.1.** Adding a New Expense: 
Write an INSERT statement to add a new expense record to your Expense Tracker. Include details like amount, date, and category (e.g., groceries purchase on a specific date with a certain amount).

**1.2.** Updating an Expense:  
Modify an existing expense record. You can change the amount, date, or category for a specific expense ID.

**1.3.** Simulating Data Deletion:  
Create a copy of your "Expenses" table. Practice deleting a record using DELETE on this copy (remember not to delete from your main data set).

## Bonus Challenge 

Handling NULL Values:  
Check if there are any NULL values in your "Expenses" table. If so, explore how you might handle them using conditional updates or setting default values (consider the feasibility based on your sample data).
